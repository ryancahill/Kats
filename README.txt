Welcome to the Kats App!

To get things running, follow these simple steps:
1. Clone this directory to your local machine.
2. Open the local copy in your project IDE of choice. I use VS Code. You may view the code in the IDE. When you are ready to run the program goto step 3.
3. Open a command prompt in the local project directory.
4. Run command npm install
5. Run command npm run dev. This should run localhost:3000
6. Open a web browser to localhost:3000

While in the app, follow these steps:
1. Click on an image to favorite it.
2. Click on the Favorites link to view favorites.
3. While on the Favorites page, click on an image to remove it from favorites.
4. If you attempt to favorite an image twice, you will get an error message.
5. To filter the image list by category or image file type, use the drop down list and/or the checkboxes and click 'Apply'.
